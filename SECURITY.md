zk-SNARKs
zk-SNARKs, or Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge, are a powerful cryptographic tool used in blockchain technology. They enhance privacy and efficiency by allowing one party to prove possession of certain information without revealing the information itself.Understanding zk-SNARKszk-SNARKs enable proofs to be both succinct and non-interactive. A proof can be verified quickly compared to traditional proofs, and no back-and-forth communication is required between the prover and verifier. These properties make zk-SNARKs suitable for scalable and efficient verification in blockchain systems.# Security Policy
